# Group Assignment 5: Regression

Due Sun 19 Apr by 23:59 via Blackboard submission.

You will analyze the data you downloaded in assignment 1, and optionally other new data as needed. Create a new Jupyter notebook. Use geopandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed. Using the techniques we learned in class, do the following:

  1. conduct a inferential analysis such as difference-in-means or estimate a population parameter from a sample
  1. estimate and interpret a regression model

Each step above should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains your analysis, why you set it up the way you did, and how you interpret its results.

At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each group member and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each).

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals/output can be seen inline (without me having to re-run it). Restart your kernel, run all cells, then save/submit your notebook and any necessary data files, zipped, via Blackboard.
