# Reading Responses

## Instructions

These exercises are designed to help you reflect critically on the weekly reading material and come to class prepared to discuss. Each reading response should be submitted as a PDF file, 1 page long, composed in 12-point Times New Roman font and single-spaced. Submit it via Blackboard by 23:59 the day before class.

The reading responses will be graded according to the following criteria:

  - Did you make it clear you read and understood the week's assigned reading material
  - Did you reflect critically and creatively on the reading material in your own words
  - Did you succinctly and directly respond to the prompt without repetition, filler, or fluff
  - Did you follow the formatting and submission instructions

## Prompts

### Reading Response 1

Briefly summarize Macdonald's social and political history of the ACS with a short paragraph in your own words. Then, in your own experience, reflect on how data collection, gathering, and interpretation are influenced by wider social, political, and cultural contexts and undercurrents.

### Reading Response 2

Briefly summarize how Python compares to other programming languages and why it has grown in popularity in recent years. Then, reflect on how coding might be useful in your own professional or academic life, now or in the future. If you have prior coding experience, you can draw on that too. If you do not, consider what new avenues coding literacy may open up for you.

### Reading Response 3

What are descriptive statistics useful for? How can they be used to mislead? Provide an example from your own experience of a time when descriptive statistics were used to deceive or mislead the public, whether intentionally or unintentionally (consider recent news stories, political issues, advocacy groups, etc).
