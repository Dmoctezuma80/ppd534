# Final Project

## Overview

The final project is a cumulative and applied assignment that requires you to use the skills you developed over the entire semester. I want you to develop an interesting research question then answer it using the statistics, modeling, and visualization methods we have learned in this course.

## Instructions

Develop an urban research question that interests your team.

Collect data from two or more different sources, including but not limited to: census bureau, local data portals, FTP servers, or directly from an organization.

Clean, organize, merge, and process the data using pandas/geopandas into a nice analyzable format

Conduct a statistical analysis. This shall include, at a minimum, a set of descriptive statistics, some exploratory analysis, and a model, such as a multiple regression model.

Create 3 or more static data visualizations, such as scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs, etc.

Create 3 or more maps, including at least 1 choropleth map and 1 point map. Optionally consider creating an interactive web map.

Your group will present your project during the final week of class.

Write a data narrative telling the story of your analysis in 3000+ words (not including tables, figures, captions, or references). Incorporate the visualizations and analytical results into your narrative. Organize it into five sections: 1, introduction (provide an overview of your entire project); 2, background (explain the context, prior work, and motivation leading to your research question). 3, methods (explain your data and your analytical process). 4, results (lay out your findings and visuals). 5, discussion (circle back to your research question and what your analysis tells you about it; what is the big picture; how are these findings useful?). At the top of the first page, include your names, the date, your project title, and the word count (not including tables, figures, captions, or references). At the end of the paper, describe each group member's contribution to this final project (one sentence each).

## Submission

Due Wed 6 May, via Blackboard submission. Please submit a zip file containing the narrative (as PDF), your visualization and map image files, web maps (if any), and the Jupyter notebook(s) and data files used to complete this project. Make sure everything is runnable and reproducible. Late final project submissions will not be accepted or graded.
