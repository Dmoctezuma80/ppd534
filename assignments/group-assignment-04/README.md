# Group Assignment 4: Mapping

Due Wed 4 Mar by 23:59 via Blackboard submission.

You will analyze the data you downloaded in assignment 1, and optionally other new data as needed. Create a new Jupyter notebook. Use geopandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed.

Join two datasets together (either a merge, or a spatial join). Using the mapping techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data. Create at least 3 static maps and explain both the map's interpretation and projection that you chose to use (in markdown). These maps can be plotted with geopandas directly or with cartopy. Each map should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains what you are visualizing and why it is interesting. Optionally, create an interactive web map, either using folium, carto, or leaflet directly.

At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each group member and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each).

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook). Then submit your notebook, (optional) web map file, and your data file, all zipped together, via Blackboard.
