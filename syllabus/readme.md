## Course Description

This course provides you with a toolkit for telling stories with urban data. Each week will focus on a single thematic learning module consisting of a lecture and a workshop. The former will introduce core concepts and methods for a specific skill and the latter allows the students to practice these skills together in class.

This course takes a computational social science approach to urban informatics. It uses Python and Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate coding and geospatial methods that students can reproduce and experiment with in real-time in the classroom. We start the semester with the fundamentals of coding, then move on to data wrangling and analysis, then on to the theory and practice of analytical visualization, web mapping, urban spatial analysis, and introductory spatial statistics. Building up core concepts in this way gives students some fundamental quick-wins before moving on to high-level informatics/analytics applications.

Each week, students will be expected to:

  - Complete and discuss all assigned readings
  - Attend the lecture
  - Participate in the workshop exercises following the lecture
  - Complete and submit any assignments

The course has no specific prerequisites, but students ideally have some prior experience with GIS and/or basic statistics. Coding itself will be taught from the ground-up. However, this course requires a lot of patience. It is by nature experimental and will require lots of trial-and-error, self-direction, practice, repetition, and experimentation on your part. Please note that this syllabus is a living document and may be updated by the instructor during the semester as needed.




## Learning Objectives

  - Critically evaluate, interpret, and interrogate social science evidence
  - Write simple code to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data including from the census and open government portals
  - Tell stories using a combination of text and visuals about public issues using data and evidence
  - Evaluate the politics and ethics underlying data as technology and innovation impact cities and planning processes




## Questions and Assistance

I am available if you need help throughout the semester and I am happy to answer your questions. By email, you should expect a reply typically within one working day. Office hours info is provided at the beginning of the syllabus. Given the nature of this course, I do expect a few things of you before you seek my assistance with code:

  1. Close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again
  2. Search google and stackoverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you're struggling with or the error message you are seeing)
  3. Go back through the relevant lecture materials to look for any insights
  4. Go back through the assigned reading materials to look for any insights

If the above steps haven't solved your problem, shoot me an email (or drop by office hours) and include the following information:

  1. A detailed description of what you're trying to do, why, and how
  2. A [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your code so far
  3. What you've already tried to do to solve your problem and what you have learned from it (specifically, explain to me the results of steps 1-4 above, including relevant links from stackoverflow etc)

I do not ask for this to be pedantic. Rather, I need it to be able to help you solve your problem.




## Materials

Due to copyrights, course reading materials will be shared on blackboard for enrolled students to freely download. The course lectures assume you that have read the assigned readings prior to the class session and are now reasonably fluent in their contents and ready to discuss/debate them in class.

Coursework will be based on free open-source software like Anaconda Python, QGIS, Carto, Docker, Git.




## Assignments and Evaluation

Per USC guidelines, for each course unit the university expects 2 hours of out-of-class student work per week. This is a 4 unit course. Therefore, expect an average of 8 hours of out-of-class work each week. The balance will vary from week to week, but this will comprise a mix of individual reading, individual writing assignments, and group assignments. Each assignment is assigned in the module listed in the schedule below and is due the following Wednesday by 23:59.

Active participation is expected (and graded) in the classroom. Most weeks, the instructor will provide a set of in-class prompts derived from the assigned readings. The groups will have 30 minutes in-class to prepare a 10 minute presentation to answer those prompts, then present it. Every group member is expected to speak, at least briefly, as part of these exercises.

Final grades will be assigned according to the following, for a total of 1000 points:

  - 200: 10 individual reading responses (20 points each)
  - 300: 5 group projects (60 points each)
  - 200: midterm exam
  - 200: final group project
  - 100: active participation in classroom and team work

Assignments are due by 23:59 pacific time on their due date, to be submitted on blackboard. Late assignment submissions will be deducted 20% per day. Late final project submissions will not be accepted or graded.

## Academic Conduct and Support

### Accommodations and Extensions

Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability or ongoing mental health concern is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to the instructor as early in the semester as possible, as the accommodation can only be implemented upon receipt of the letter. Visit DSP's [web site](https://dsp.usc.edu/) for more details. For further support, I encourage you to contact USC Support and Advocacy (uscsupport@usc.edu). To maintain fairness and equality for all students, extensions to due dates are only granted in accordance with these official accommodation letters. If you need to request a *one-time emergency* extension (e.g., due to a major illness or to a death in the family) you must do the following proactively *prior to the due date*: 1) provide written documentation (such as an official doctor's note) explaining that you are unable to complete the assignment by its due date and 2) work out an extension with the instructor.

### Academic Integrity

USC seeks to maintain an optimal learning environment. General principles of academic honesty include the concept of respect for the intellectual property of others, the expectation that individual work will be submitted unless otherwise allowed by an instructor, and the obligations both to protect one's own academic work from misuse by others as well as to avoid using another's work as one's own. Plagiarism (presenting someone else's ideas or work as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words) is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. This includes submitting code that someone else wrote. All students are expected to understand and abide by these principles. See the [student handbook](https://scampus.usc.edu) for more details.
