# Module 3: Coding Bootcamp I

## Overview

In this module we will introduce the basics of Python, a powerful programming language for data analysis, visualization, and software development. It's a great starter language because its syntax is simple and straightforward. Unlike some other niche programming languages, Python is more general purpose, more similar to other popular language's (like JavaScript) conventions, and more widely adopted around the world. We will work with Python via the Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks let you use Python in an interactive coding environment that's easily packaged up and shared with others.

## Getting started

When you get to class, follow [the instructions](../) on "how to launch a Jupyter notebook lecture" before the lecture begins, so you're ready to go.
